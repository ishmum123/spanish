# Runs every check that must pass before shipping the Spanish pack/site:
#   1. packbuilder check         - pack-level schema/coverage/article checks
#      (engine/tools/packbuilder/qa/check.py with the Spanish spec)
#   2. engine/tools/validate_pack.py - engine's schema, referential-integrity,
#      and generated-.js-in-sync checks
#   3. stale-build guard (engine/tools/check_site.sh) - rebuilds index.html and sw.js
#      to a scratch dir and byte-compares them against the committed files, and checks
#      both are tracked by git and committed, so a forgotten `./build.sh` or a page
#      published without its sw.js is caught here rather than shipping stale.
# Usage: ./check.sh   (PACKBUILDER_PATH=<vocab-engine>/tools overrides engine/tools)
