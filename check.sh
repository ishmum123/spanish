# Runs every check that must pass before shipping the Spanish pack/site:
#   1. packbuilder check         - pack-level schema/coverage/article checks
#      (engine/tools/packbuilder/qa/check.py with the Spanish spec)
#   2. engine/tools/validate_pack.py - engine's schema, referential-integrity,
#      and generated-.js-in-sync checks
#   3. stale-build guard - rebuilds index.html to a scratch file and
#      byte-compares it against the committed one, so a forgotten
#      `./build.sh` after editing the pack or engine is caught here
#      rather than shipping a stale page.
# Usage: ./check.sh   (PACKBUILDER_PATH=<vocab-engine>/tools overrides engine/tools)
